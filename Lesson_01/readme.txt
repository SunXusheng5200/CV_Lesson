The assignment can combine image crop, color shift, rotation and perspective transform together.
This file is the introduction of the assignment01.py.

Frist you should input the path of the image you want to process follow the program.

Parameter Description:
1. crop : img, height_co, width_co
img: the path of the image you want to program.
height_co : the height coefficient you want to crap .
width_co : the width coefficient you want to crap.
(if you input height_co = 100, width_co = 200, the image will be crapped as [100, 200].
mention : the height_co and width_co can't be bigger than the scale of the image you input.)

2. rotation : img, angle
img : the path of the image you want to program.
angle : the angle you want the image to rotate.

3. colorShift : img, scale
img : the path of the image you want to program.
scale : the parameter you can change to choose a larger or a smaller scale which the pixels will be distributed in.

4. random_wrap : img, random_margin
img £ºthe path of the image you want to program.
random_margin : you can change this parameter to change the range of coordinate value distribution.
